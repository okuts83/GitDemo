Generating HTML reports

1) we need to install HTML module, if we don't have

C:\Users\okuts\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts >>> cmd >> pip install pytest-html

2) After that we can run our tests with creating HTML reports:

C:\Users\okuts\PycharmProjects\UdemyPython\pytestdemo >>> cmd >>>

>>> pytest --html=report.html -s -v   (""-s" ""-v" -options)

When HTML report created >>> copy path to this file and open report.html

Logs can be implemented in HTML report too, just add logs to test cases
- how to add >>> check logs.txt + BaseClass + test_fixturesDataWithHTMLLogs.py files
